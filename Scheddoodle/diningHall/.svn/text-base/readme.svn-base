source [hours conracted/desired] users [shift length (min/max)] shift [shift length (min/max)] sink

The dining hall algorithm would be an unsplittable flow problem, which is NP-complete and has had a lot of research done on it providing good approximation algorithms, except for a small glitch based upon the fact that all dinner shifts don't have lengths strictly within a factor of two of each other, so no pre-made really good approximations for us.

Bin packing, with the users as bins that shifts are packed in to.

Took inspiration in the final algorithm from the method of student managers and from approximations to bin packing.

Important Values
	Shifts: number of workers still available for that shift, worker contracted hours/length of the shift
	Users: number of hours still available to the user, total hours of potential shifts/contracted hours

while at least one shift is still unfilled:
	get the meal time with the lowest indegree (lowest number of workers who can work the meal time)
	for each shift in the meal time (choose the shift within the meal time randomly):
		out of users who desire more hours and can add this shift while staying within contracted hours:
			assign the user with the highest preference for that shift								} Possibly switch these
			if preferences are tied, assign the user with the most desired hours left to fill		}
			if hours tied, assign random user.
		if no desired hours left, out of all users with contracted hours left who can work this shift:
			***assign the user with the highest preference***
			**if preferences are tied, assign the user with the most contracted hours left to fill***
			random
		
UI Considerations:
tutorial?
enter contracted hours (add half an hour to that)
alter user input based upon the "reason" they give
give users meal times (not individual shifts)
option: first by preference, then by difficulty/availability of user
adding shifts after creating/running the schedule (for busy people)
