<h1 class="blocktext">What is Sched-a-roo?</h1>
<p class="blocktext">Our site is the wildly successful result of a senior comps project
designed to help Carls schedule meetings and events in timely and efficient manner.</p>
<br>
<h1 class="blocktext">Who are we?</h1>

<p>
<img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/ty2.jpg" alt="Ty Martin" height=110 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  Born and raised in the Minot, North Dakota, Ty decided to give up the farm life to experience
  big city in Northfield. In addition to heading our graphic design department, Ty likes to 
  drink muscle milk and run fast.

<p><img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/nate2.jpg" alt="Nate King" height=100 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  The Thinker (aka Nate King) was hired by Schedaroo late in 2010. An excellent addition to the
  web design team, Nate has had an hand in implementing numerous parts of the site, specializing
  in database design. In his spare time, Nate likes to toss the 'bee with his fellow GOPers.

<p><img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/dan2.jpg" alt="Dan Levy" height=160 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  Dan has dominated Sched-a-roo from day one. Thanks to his dedication, Sched-a-roo got off to a
  running start, and has left all other comps groups in the dust. In addition to helping transform
  Sched-a-roo into Google's #1 competitor, Dan also likes public transportation (especially trains).

<p><img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/brendan2.jpg" alt="Brendan Cassidy" height=100 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  Brendan hails from Modesto, home of the Nuts (MLB affiliate) and high crime rates. Brendan lead the
  Hack the Carleton Website team. One of the best hackers and an above-average macker, Brendan acquired much of the
  data required to run our site. Brendan enjoys dying his hair, and things found in nature.

<p><img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/carl2.jpg" alt="Carl Smith" height=150 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  Carl 'CS' Smith decided to attend Carleton after being told that the school was actually created in
  his name 123 years before he was born. Through our project, Carl discovered that he is a power-user 
  at heart, specifically through his implementation of advanced sorting and his constant "inverting of screen colors"*. In addition, Carl believes 
  that the 'dining hall' problem is NP-complete, yet after 5 weeks has still failed to provide any sort of proof.
<br>* His words

<p><img src="<?php echo URL ?>/images/wes2.jpg" alt="Wesley Elfman" height=150 width=125 style="float: left; padding:5px">
  Wesley Elfman, esquire, the project manager of Schedaroo, pioneered its australian theme. Always encouraging us to keep
  our users "one hop away from scheduling their next event", it was Wes who kept us going when our color scheme was terrible
  and our spirits were low. He has the softest heart on the team. Dan Levy gets all mushy inside when he sees him.
