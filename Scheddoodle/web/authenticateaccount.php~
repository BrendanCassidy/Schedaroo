<h2>What is Scheddoodle?</h2>
<p>Scheddoodle is a Carleton-only scheduling assistant, created by our "Scheddoodle" CS comps group. The idea is to make it easier to pick a date and time for your event.</p>

<h2>Why use Scheddoodle?</h2>
<p>Why not? Give it a shot, and we can do the work for you, whether you need to schedule a group meeting or you want to find a way to meet up with as many people as possible.</p>

<h2>I got an email saying someone invited me to a schedule. What now?</h2>
<p>First you have to verify your account. If you are listed in the Carleton directory, we have you in our records. Just enter your Carleton username in the form on this page, and you'll get an email with a password to log into the website.</p>
