This is the source code of Schedaroo, a scheduling website developed at Carleton College <http://carleton.edu> by Carl Smith, Ty Martin, Dan Levy, Nathan King, Wes Elfman, and Brendan Cassidy. This project was performed in partial completion of the Senior Integrative Exercise in Computer Science. 

The site can be accessed from the Carleton campus at <http://cs-research1.mathcs.carleton.edu/scheddoodle/>. Have fun!
